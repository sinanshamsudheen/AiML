The firm's chips are widely used in various end markets, including PC gaming and data centers. In recent years, NVIDIA has broadened its focus from traditional PC graphics applications such as gaming to more complex and favorable opportunities, including artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, leveraging the high-performance capabilities of its products.\\n\\nCurrently, NVIDIA's stock price stands at $418.01, significantly higher than the GF Value of $310.28, indicating the stock might be overvalued. With a market cap of $1 trillion, the valuation seems steep. The following analysis aims to delve deeper into the company's value.\\n\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nUnderstanding the GF Value\\nThe GF Value is a unique measure of the intrinsic value of a stock, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.\\n\\nAccording to GuruFocus Value calculation, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be significantly overvalued. The stock's current price of $418.01 per share and the market cap of $1 trillion further strengthen this assumption.\\n\\nGiven that NVIDIA is significantly overvalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.\\n\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.\\n\\nFinancial Strength of NVIDIA\\nExamining the financial strength of a company is crucial before investing in its stock. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. NVIDIA's cash-to-debt ratio of 1.27 is worse than 58.04% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. However, NVIDIA's overall financial strength is 8 out of 10, indicating a strong financial position.\\n\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nProfitability and Growth\\nConsistent profitability over the long term reduces the risk for investors. NVIDIA, with its profitability ranking of 10 out of 10, has been profitable for the past 10 years. The company's operating margin of 17.37% ranks better than 76.5% of companies in the Semiconductors industry.\\n\\nHowever, growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. NVIDIA's growth ranks worse than 52.99% of companies in the Semiconductors industry, with its 3-year average revenue growth rate better than 87.88% of companies in the industry.\\n\\nROIC vs WACC\\nComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is an effective way to evaluate its profitability. Over the past 12 months, NVIDIA's ROIC was 20.32 while its WACC was 16.74, suggesting that the company is creating value for its shareholders.\\n\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be significantly overvalued. Despite its strong financial condition and profitability, its growth ranks lower than 52.99% of companies in the Semiconductors industry.

Speaking at the VivaTech 2025 event in Paris, Huang dismissed claims made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who recently said that AI could wipe out nearly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next few years.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHuang strongly disagreed with that prediction, saying that while AI will certainly change how people work, it also opens up new possibilities. He also suggested that AI has already changed his job, adding that instead of fearing AI, people should focus on learning how to use it responsibly. He also compared the development of AI to medical research, suggesting it should be done openly and with input from many experts.\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time Huang has spoken about AI and jobs. At another major event — the Milken Institute Global Conference last month, he said that AI isn’t going to directly take people’s jobs, but those who understand how to use AI tools might end up replacing those who don’t. “Every job will be affected, and immediately,” he said, pointing out that the real risk lies in being left behind in a changing work environment.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHuang explained that today, only a small portion of the global population, around 30 million people, actually know how to use AI effectively. He believes that as more people gain these skills, it will become a powerful tool for improving productivity and creating new types of work.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Amodei remains cautious. In an earlier interview with Axios, he warned that the rise of AI could lead to major job losses in fields like law, finance, tech, and consulting. He even predicted that per cent companies might stop listing many new jobs, as AI would take over most entry-level responsibilities. “The economy might grow fast, but 20 per cent of people could end up without jobs,” Amodei said.\\n\\nWhile views on AI’s impact continue to differ among industry leaders, Huang is trying to say that instead of worrying about machines taking over, people should focus on understanding and using AI. The future of work, according to him, will belong to those who know how to work with this technology, not those who fear it.\\n\\nPublished By:\\n\\nAnkita Garg\\n\\nPublished On:\\n\\nJun 12, 2025\\n\\nWatch Live TV\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAlso Watch\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking for India is a national duty: Anand Sharma, Op Sindoor global envoy\\n\\nLalu Prasad Yadav\\n\\nWatch: Lalu Yadav cuts humongous cake of laddoos with sword on 78th birthday\\n\\nMurder Case: Accuseds Brother Demands Justice\\n\\nHang her if she is found guilty: Sonam Raghuvanshi's brother\\n\\n\\n\\nLt Commander Yashasvi Solanki Becomes First Woman Naval ADC to President\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Sorry: Elon-e-Musk\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRead This\\n\\nCopilot gets accidentally uninstalled in latest Windows 11 update\\n\\nFirst ever security flaw detected in an AI agent\\n\\nMitchell Starc,Tema Bavuma (AP Photo)\\n\\nWTC Final: Timid or outclassed?
